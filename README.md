## ‚ö° Fun Fact

Did you know that C# was initially named "Cool"? It was later changed to C# during development as a homage to the musical notation where "#" represents a sharp note, indicating that C# was designed to be a higher-level language than C and aimed to provide greater productivity and ease of use for developers. So, next time you write some code in C#, remember that it's the "cool" choice for modern software development!
